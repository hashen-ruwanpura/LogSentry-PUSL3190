## üîß Technical Architecture

The platform employs a modular architecture with specialized components:

- **Log Ingestion**: Collects and normalizes logs from various sources
- **Threat Detection**: Analyzes normalized logs using rules and ML algorithms
- **Alert Management**: Processes detected threats and generates appropriate alerts
- **Notification Delivery**: Distributes alerts across configured channels
- **MITRE Mapping**: Classifies threats according to the ATT&CK framework
- **Predictive Analytics**: Monitors system health and predicts maintenance needs
- **Report Generation**: Creates comprehensive security reports and visualizations

## üìä Threat Classification Process

The platform uses a sophisticated 5-layer approach to map threats to the MITRE ATT&CK framework:

1. **Exact Attack Pattern Matching**: Direct mapping of detected attack patterns
2. **Content-Based Pattern Matching**: Analysis of log content for known signatures
3. **Attack Type Classification**: Mapping general attack types to MITRE categories
4. **Contextual Analysis**: Intelligent inference based on extracted context
5. **URL Heuristics**: Analysis of URL patterns when other methods fail

Threats are assigned severity levels (low, medium, high, critical) based on:
- Attack score calculation
- Pattern matching results
- Context (admin paths, sensitive endpoints)
- Known malicious IP reputation
- MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques
